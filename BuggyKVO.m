This bug occurs when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) with custom objects. If the custom object's `isEqual:` method isn't properly implemented, KVO might not work correctly, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  The issue is that KVO relies on `isEqual:` to determine if the observed object has actually changed. An improperly implemented `isEqual:` can cause KVO to miss changes or trigger unnecessarily.
