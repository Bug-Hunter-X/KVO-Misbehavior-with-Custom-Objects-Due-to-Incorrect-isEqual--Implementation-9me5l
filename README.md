# Objective-C KVO Bug: isEqual: Implementation

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using Key-Value Observing (KVO) in Objective-C with custom objects.  The problem arises when the `isEqual:` method of the observed object is not correctly implemented.  This can lead to KVO missing updates or triggering updates incorrectly.

The `BuggyKVO.m` file shows the buggy implementation.  The `FixedKVO.m` file provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description
KVO relies on the `isEqual:` method to determine if a change has actually occurred. An improperly implemented `isEqual:` method can prevent KVO from correctly recognizing changes or trigger unnecessary updates, leading to inconsistent application behavior or crashes.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the `BuggyKVO.m` example. Observe the incorrect behavior.
3. Compile and run the `FixedKVO.m` example. Observe the corrected behavior.

## Solution
The solution is to correctly implement the `isEqual:` method in your custom class. Ensure that it compares all relevant properties of the object to determine equality.
